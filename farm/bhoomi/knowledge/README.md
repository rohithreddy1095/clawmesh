# Bhoomi Knowledge Seeds

This directory stores structured knowledge that informs planning and research but is not the live farm state.

Examples:

- cross-location patterns from Bhoomi project videos
- crop suitability research notes
- trial design heuristics
- seasonal observations summaries

Rule:

- mark non-field-verified insights as `inference_repo` or `inference_external`
