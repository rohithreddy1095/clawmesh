        Location: Ganugabanda, Garidepally mandal, Suryapet district, Telangana,
        India 508201.

        Context: Eco & self-sustainable farm stay. Mud, stone, and wood cottages
        native to the area. I have two cows and a 16x16x5 water storage made of
        cement and stone.
      source: json_export_state
    site_diagnostics:
      rainfall_analysis: The Suryapet region experiences a semi-arid tropical climate
        with an average annual rainfall of approximately 750mm to 850mm,
        concentrated heavily between June and September. High evaporation rates
        during the scorching summer months (March-May) make moisture retention
        and shading critical for your farm stay.
      soil_composition: Visual analysis of the fallow patches and regional data
        suggest a predominance of Red Sandy Loam (locally known as Chalka soil).
        This soil is excellent for drainage but requires significant organic
        matter—which your two cows can provide—to improve its water-holding
        capacity for the food forest.
      sun_exposure: Located at approximately 17 degrees North, the site receives
        intense vertical solar radiation. To maintain comfort in mud cottages,
        we must orient buildings along an East-West axis to minimize wall
        exposure to the rising and setting sun, utilizing the dense existing
        tree clusters for natural micro-climate buffering.
      critical_questions: &a1
        - Is your existing 16x16x5 water storage currently fed by a borewell or
          surface runoff, and would you be open to converting its perimeter into
          a biological filter (wetland) to treat and reuse cottage greywater for
          the orchard?
        - Regarding the 'native wood' for your cottages, do you have access to local
          Neem or Teak timber from the property, or should we source reclaimed
          wood from the nearby Suryapet/Nalgonda markets to maintain a
          zero-carbon footprint?

          title: "Strategic Vision: The Deccan Oasis"
          content: Our philosophy centers on 'The Deccan Oasis'—a regenerative sanctuary
            that honors the semi-arid landscape of Suryapet. By clustering
            vernacular mud cottages within the existing central canopy, we
            create a micro-climate that reduces ambient temperature by 5-8°C.
            The layout follows a 'Goshala-Centric' model, where the cow shelter
            serves as the nutrient hub, providing manure for the food forest and
            biogas for the kitchen, weaving livestock into the guest experience
            as a symbol of rural harmony.
          style: ISOMETRIC

            farm stay. Mud cottages with red-tiled roofs are nestled within a
            dense green canopy. A traditional stone Goshala is the central
            focus, with winding paths connecting to a large square water tank
            and vibrant vegetable patches.

          title: "Hydro-Logic Systems: The Living Tank"
          content: We will retrofit your existing 16x16x5 cement tank into a 'Living
            Tank.' The perimeter will feature a multi-stage biological wetland
            filter using Canna Lily and Vetiver grass to treat greywater from
            the cottages. This recycled water, rich in nutrients, will
            gravity-feed a network of swales and 'Banana Circles' to maximize
            the 750mm annual rainfall. The stone walls of the tank will be
            wrapped in local creepers to reduce evaporation and keep the water
            cool for irrigation.

            stone basin, then into an orchard of fruit trees.

          title: "Structures & Vernacular: Red Earth & Granite"
          content: Architecture will utilize 'Chalka' (Red Sandy Loam) for stabilized
            earth blocks or cob walls, providing high thermal mass for the hot
            Telangana summers. Foundations and plinths will use rough-hewn local
            granite to prevent rising damp. Roofs will be constructed using
            reclaimed teak or neem timber from local markets, topped with
            Mangalore tiles or thick thatch. This 'Zero-Carbon' approach ensures
            the buildings breathe and age gracefully with the land.

            Features include a raised granite stone base, thick red mud walls,

            sloping terracotta tile roof.

          content: The regenerative canopy will feature Mango, Jamun, and Custard Apple,
            underplanted with turmeric and ginger. Adjacent, we propose a DIY
            'Nutrient Lab'—a bamboo-framed greenhouse with a UV-stabilized film.
            Inside, intensive microgreen production will occur on vertical racks
            holding black nursery trays. A network of hanging overhead misters
            will maintain 70% humidity for fast-turnaround crops like sunflower
            shoots, radish, and wheatgrass, providing high-nutrient greens for
            farm-stay guests.
          style: WATERCOLOR
          visualization_prompt: Interior view of a functional DIY greenhouse with a bamboo
            structure. Rows of black plastic seedling trays are filled with
            dense, vibrant green micro-sprouts. A fine mist is spraying from

            creating a soft fog.

          title: "Energy & Solar: The Sun-Harvest Grid"
          content: To achieve full electrical self-sufficiency, we will install a 4kW
            system comprising 8-10 high-efficiency crystalline solar panels.
            These will be ground-mounted on a south-facing slope using local
            stone pillars to integrate aesthetically. The system will include a
            hybrid inverter and a lithium-ferro-phosphate (LFP) battery bank
            housed in a ventilated mud-brick 'Power Room' to ensure the
            batteries stay cool, powering all LED lighting, fans, and the
            micro-irrigation pumps.
          style: ISOMETRIC
          visualization_prompt: A neat installation of 10 modern solar panels mounted on
            rustic, rough-cut granite stone bases. The panels are tilted toward
            the sun, situated in a field of low-growing native wildflowers with
            the farm cottages visible in the background.

          content: "Social life revolves around the 'Circular Hearth'—a communal fire-pit
            and dining space built from local stone. Waste is managed through a
            'Closed Loop' system: kitchen scraps go to the cows or chickens, cow
            dung feeds the biogas digester and vermicompost pits, and the
            resulting compost returns to the food forest. This system
            demonstrates the beauty of zero-waste living to every visitor,
            turning waste management into an educational social node."

        text: Excellent. With the biological filter and reclaimed timber strategy set, I
          see a beautiful canopy cluster in the center of your site—ideal for
          nesting the mud cottages to shield them from the intense Deccan sun.
          To finalize the blueprint, how many cottages are you envisioning, and
          should we integrate a traditional *Goshala* (cow shelter) as a focal
          point for your guests to interact with? Once confirmed, I am ready to
          generate the vision boards.

  farm_twin_mapping_hints:
    - target: site.profile + goals + existing_assets
      rationale: Project context often contains location details, farm goals, and
        existing infrastructure.
      action: Extract explicit assets (e.g., tank dimensions, cows, structures) into
        site/assets YAML after validation.
    - target: site.climate_notes + zone.soil_profile hypotheses
      rationale: Mr Green diagnostics are useful starting hypotheses for
        climate/soil/sun modeling.
      action: Tag as design-time inference and confirm with local
        measurements/observations.
    - target: operations / assets / trials / human goals
      rationale: Vision boards mix infrastructure ideas, social loops, energy systems,
        and production concepts.
      action: Break each board into concrete candidate tasks and candidate assets.
    - target: survey tasks + decision log
      rationale: Critical questions represent unresolved constraints and choices.
      action: Convert each question into a field survey task or explicit decision
        record.
