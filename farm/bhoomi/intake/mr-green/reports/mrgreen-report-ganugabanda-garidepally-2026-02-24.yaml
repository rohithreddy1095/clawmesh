    site_diagnostics:
      rainfall_analysis: Ganugabanda, Garidepally, Telangana, typically experiences a
        semi-arid climate with an average annual rainfall of 750-850 mm,
        predominantly during the monsoon season (June-September).
      soil_composition: The visual cues of the reddish-brown soil in the central plot
        are characteristic of Deccan red sandy loams. These soils generally have
        good drainage, are moderately fertile, and are likely slightly acidic to
        neutral (pH 6.5-7.0).
      sun_exposure: Based on the location in Telangana, the site receives abundant
        year-round solar exposure. The sun path will be high during summer
        months and lower in winter, making south-facing installations optimal
        for maximum solar gain.

          title: "Strategic Vision: Ganugabanda Regenerative Farm"
          content: Our vision for Ganugabanda is to transform the irregularly shaped
            quadrilateral plot into a thriving, self-sufficient permaculture
            ecosystem. This involves enhancing the existing traditional Goshala
            and biogas system, establishing a multi-layered food forest,
            implementing robust water harvesting, and generating clean energy.
            The design prioritizes local Deccan materials – red soil mud walls,
            rough-hewn granite, teak wood, and cooling Mangalore tile roofs –
            ensuring harmony with the rural Telangana landscape. The goal is a
            resilient, productive, and beautiful space that fosters ecological
            balance and community well-being, contained strictly within the
            irregularly shaped quadrilateral plot boundaries, bounded by
            cultivated green fields on its north, west, and south sides, and a
            clear path along its northeastern edge.

          icon: 💧
          title: "Hydro-Logic Systems: Water Harvesting & Cycling"
          content: Given Ganugabanda's semi-arid climate, a comprehensive water management
            strategy is paramount. We will implement roof rainwater harvesting
            from the traditional Goshala, directing it via simple guttering into
            a small, strategically placed farm pond or tank. Contour swales,
            lined with local rough-hewn granite stones for stability and
            aesthetics, will be dug across the gently undulating terrain of the
            reddish-brown plot to capture and infiltrate monsoon rainfall,
            recharging groundwater and nourishing the nascent food forest.
            Greywater from the rustic outdoor kitchen will be filtered through a
            simple reed bed system before being used for non-edible plant
            irrigation, creating a closed-loop water system contained strictly
            within the irregularly shaped quadrilateral plot boundaries.

          icon: 🏡
          title: "Structures & Vernacular: Rooted in Tradition"
          content: The existing traditional Goshala (stone & thatch) and rustic outdoor
            kitchen are foundational to the site's character. Any new ancillary
            structures, such as a tool shed or a dedicated processing area, will
            strictly adhere to Telangana vernacular architecture. This means
            utilizing locally sourced red soil for mud walls, rough-hewn granite
            for sturdy plinths, and teak wood for structural detailing and
            finishes. Cooling Mangalore tile roofs will replace or complement
            thatch where appropriate, offering durability and thermal comfort.
            This approach ensures new constructions blend seamlessly with the
            existing aesthetic and climate, all contained strictly within the
            irregularly shaped quadrilateral plot boundaries.

          icon: 🌱
          title: "Polyculture & Microgreens: Regenerative Growth"
          content: Our regenerative approach will expand beyond the small cultivated patch
            into a multi-layered food forest (regenerative canopy) across the
            reddish-brown plot. This polyculture will feature native,
            drought-tolerant species like Custard Apple, Jamun, and Neem for
            shade, fodder, and fruit. Nitrogen-fixing legumes will enhance soil
            fertility, while understory herbs and vegetables thrive.
            Additionally, a dedicated DIY microgreens greenhouse will be
            established. Constructed with a bamboo or reclaimed wood frame and
            UV-stabilized poly-film, this greenhouse will house intensive
            microgreen production in rows of black nursery trays, nourished by a
            network of hanging overhead misters/sprinklers. The nutrient-rich
            digestate from the biogas plant will be a key fertilizer for both
            the food forest and the microgreens, ensuring high-nutrient density
            and fast turnaround crops, all contained strictly within the
            irregularly shaped quadrilateral plot boundaries.

          icon: ☀️
          title: "Energy & Solar Systems: Self-Sufficient Power"
          content: Achieving full electrical self-sufficiency for the farm is a core
            objective. We will install an array of 8-10 high-efficiency
            monocrystalline solar panels. These will be ground-mounted on a
            sturdy, south-facing frame, integrated with local rough-hewn granite
            stone bases for stability and aesthetic alignment with the
            vernacular. This setup will be positioned in an open, sun-exposed
            area of the reddish-brown plot. A robust lithium-ion battery bank
            will store excess energy for night-time and cloudy periods. This
            system will power essential farm needs, including lighting for the
            Goshala and rustic kitchen, and the misters and small pumps within
            the microgreens greenhouse. While biogas remains primary for
            cooking, solar energy will provide reliable electricity, all
            contained strictly within the irregularly shaped quadrilateral plot
            boundaries.

          title: "Community & Social Loops: Nurturing Connections"
          content: "This project envisions a farm that is not only ecologically productive
            but also socially enriching. Waste management will be circular:
            organic kitchen scraps and plant residues will feed a communal
            composting system, while the post-digester slurry from the biogas
            plant will be utilized in a vermicomposting setup to create highly
            fertile soil amendments. A simple, inviting shaded seating area,
            crafted from local stone benches and nestled under a newly planted
            native canopy tree, will serve as a social node near the rustic
            outdoor kitchen, fostering communal gathering, sharing, and
            learning. This space can also host informal workshops on
            permaculture principles or traditional crafts, strengthening
            community bonds, all contained strictly within the irregularly
            shaped quadrilateral plot boundaries."

    - target: site.profile + goals + existing_assets
      rationale: Project context often contains location details, farm goals, and
        existing infrastructure.
      action: Extract explicit assets (e.g., tank dimensions, cows, structures) into
        site/assets YAML after validation.
    - target: site.climate_notes + zone.soil_profile hypotheses
      rationale: Mr Green diagnostics are useful starting hypotheses for
        climate/soil/sun modeling.
      action: Tag as design-time inference and confirm with local
        measurements/observations.
    - target: operations / assets / trials / human goals
      rationale: Vision boards mix infrastructure ideas, social loops, energy systems,
        and production concepts.
      action: Break each board into concrete candidate tasks and candidate assets.
